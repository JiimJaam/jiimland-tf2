Welcome to the server! Enjoy your stay!
Servers automatically restart when there is a Steam, TF2, or Linux update.

=== RULES ===
1. No bigotry, such as homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, ableism, etc.
2. No pornographic, gory, offensive, or otherwise disturbing sprays/Conscientious Objectors.
3. Don't abuse cheats or use unfair scripts (auto-bhop for example).
4. Don't ask for Admin or VIP.
5. Don't target specific players to annoy them.
6. Friendlies are allowed, but so is killing them. Friendlies can also fight back if they care to. Basically, kill who you want but don't get mad if they retaliate.

Breaking any of these rules will result in a kick/ban as admins see fit.
